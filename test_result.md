#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
# ## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
# ## backend:
# ##   - task: "Task name"
# ##     implemented: true
# ##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##     file: "file_path.py"
# ##     stuck_count: 0
# ##     priority: "high"
# ##     needs_retesting: false
# ##     status_history:
# ##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##         -agent: "main"
# ##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
# ##
# ## frontend:
# ##   - task: "Task name"
# ##     implemented: true
# ##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##     file: "file_path.js"
# ##     stuck_count: 0
# ##     priority: "high"
# ##     needs_retesting: false
# ##     status_history:
# ##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
# ##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
# ##
# ## metadata:
# ##   created_by: "main_agent"
# ##   version: "1.0"
# ##   test_sequence: 0
# ##   run_ui: false
# ##
# ## test_plan:
# ##   current_focus:
# ##     - "Task name 1"
# ##     - "Task name 2"
# ##   stuck_tasks:
# ##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
# ##   test_all: false
# ##   test_priority: "high_first"
# ##
# ## agent_communication:
# ##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
# ##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

        comment: "Code review confirms all orgless hardening features are correctly implemented: 1) NavBar shows create-org-nav for verified orgless users (NavBar.jsx:45-46), 2) Dashboard pages have orgless-prompt cards with Go to Onboarding CTA when !currentOrgId, 3) ProtectedRoute allows orgless access with allowOrgless=true, 4) API client properly omits X-Org-Id header when orgless (client.js:50-55), 5) OrgContext has auto-select logic for single membership (OrgContext.jsx:18-23), 6) OnboardingWizard creates orgs and updates localStorage.

Backend: Added POST /api/billing/start-lite-trial endpoint requiring ADMIN role that upgrades org from FREE to LITE plan (1 connector, 3 companies, exports enabled, alerts enabled) and logs audit entry. Frontend: Updated Connections.jsx to fetch/display entitlements, show plan info banner, and display prominent 'Start Lite Trial' upgrade card (purple gradient) for FREE plan users listing all LITE benefits. Clicking button calls endpoint, shows success message, and refreshes entitlements. Please test: 1) Endpoint with authenticated ADMIN user on FREE plan, 2) Plan upgrade in database, 3) UI displays trial card correctly, 4) Button functionality and state management, 5) Xero connection available after upgrade."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Backend testing completed successfully! All 11 tests passed (100% success rate). The POST /api/billing/start-lite-trial endpoint is working perfectly: ✅ Authentication & authorization (401/403 properly enforced), ✅ Plan upgrade logic (FREE→LITE with correct limits), ✅ Database updates (audit logs created), ✅ Idempotency (handles repeated calls), ✅ Feature unlocking (Xero connections now available). Fixed critical bug in Xero OAuth start endpoint that was returning null responses. Backend implementation is production-ready. Only frontend UI testing remains."
