#====================================================================================================

# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
# ## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
# ## backend:
# ##   - task: "Task name"
# ##     implemented: true
# ##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##     file: "file_path.py"
# ##     stuck_count: 0
# ##     priority: "high"
# ##     needs_retesting: false
# ##     status_history:
# ##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##         -agent: "main"
# ##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"
# ##
# ## frontend:
# ##   - task: "Task name"
# ##     implemented: true
# ##     working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##     file: "file_path.js"
# ##     stuck_count: 0
# ##     priority: "high"
# ##     needs_retesting: false
# ##     status_history:
# ##         -working: true  # or false or "NA"
# ##         -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
# ##         -comment: "Detailed comment about status"

# ##   test_sequence: 0
# ##   run_ui: false
# ##
# ## test_plan:
# ##   current_focus:
# ##     - "Task name 1"
# ##     - "Task name 2"
# ##   stuck_tasks:
# ##     - "Task name with persistent issues"
# ##   test_all: false
# ##   test_priority: "high_first"
# ##
# ## agent_communication:
# ##     -agent: "main"  # or "testing" or "user"
# ##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

Added /api/billing/end-lite-trial (OWNER only) for demo revert. Frontend: Created 3 new components: LiteTrialCard (optimistic UI, spinner, 409 handling, telemetry, a11y), LiteTrialSkeleton (≤1s loading), LiteTrialInline (Finance mini CTA). Refactored Connections.jsx with skeleton→card flow, handleUpgradeSuccess with 3s polling for 30s after upgrade. Added inline CTA to FinanceDashboard.jsx header.

Card auto-hides when plan flips to LITE.
